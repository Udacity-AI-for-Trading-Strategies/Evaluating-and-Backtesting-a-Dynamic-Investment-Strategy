# Evaluating and Backtesting a Dynamic Investment Strategy

## Introduction

This project will explore the concept of risk-parity, a popular portfolio management strategy that aims to allocate investments in a way that equalizes the risk contribution of each asset. This approach is widely used by hedge funds and institutional investors to create more balanced portfolios that are less sensitive to market volatility.

## Project Steps

1. Download Financial Data:

    Use the `yfinance` library to download historical price data for a selection of assets, such as stocks, bonds, and 
    commodities.

2. Calculate Returns:

    Compute the daily returns for each asset based on the price data.

3. Compute Risk-Parity Weights:

    Implement a risk-parity algorithm to calculate the optimal weights for each asset in the portfolio.

4. Backtest the Portfolio:

    Evaluate the performance of the risk-parity portfolio by calculating key financial metrics, such as annualized return, volatility, Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio, and Calmar ratio.
